# Multi Agent Workshop

Welcome to our multi-agent samples repository showcasing a retail banking scenario. This repository demonstrates several approaches to building multi-agent applications using Azure Cosmos DB.

## Build a Multi-Agent AI application using Semantic Kernel Agents or LangGraph

This branch of the repo shows how to build a multi-tenant, multi-agent, banking application with containerized applications built using 

- Semantic Kernel Agents in C#
- LangGraph in Python

To explore the other scenarios showcased in this repository. [Go to main branch](/sandeepsnairms/banking-multi-agent-workshop/tree/main)

## Branch Contents

This branch contains two folders:
- **01_exercises**: Contains the starter files for the exercises. Begin with the minimal scaffolding code and follow the step-by-step instructions to complete each exercise.

- **02_completed**: Contains the final files after completing the exercises. These can be used to run the demo directly.


## Complete the Exercises

There are two completely separate implementations for this sample multi-agent application with different instructions on how to deploy and configure for use.

- Navigate to [LangGraph Python](01_exercises/python/workshop/Module-0.md)
- Navigate to [Semantic Kernel Csharp](01_exercises/csharp/workshop/Module-0.md)


## Completed Files

If you prefer to skip the exercises and go straight to the final code and artifacts for running the demo, select one of the following options to access the completed files:

- Navigate to the [LangGraph Python](02_completed/python/README.md)
- Navigate to the [Semantic Kernel Csharp](02_completed/csharp/README.md)
